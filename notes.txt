TODO
----
* ability to use per-page google analytics by settings GA identifier in conf.py
* button to toggle sidebar
* 'mid range' styling - for smaller screens that are "just right" - remove border and padding around doc.
* try and clean up rendering of relbar menu - maybe w/ optional icons
* way to specify "redirects" from old pages - would probably have to be javascript based.
* offer alias cloud_sptheme.all_exts
